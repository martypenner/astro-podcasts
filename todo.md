- [ ] replicache local instead of reflect
- [ ] sync with partykit / whatever works
- [ ] run crons a few times a day to grab new podcasts that all clients will pull (freshness check)
- [ ] add transcripts somehow
- [ ] page titles
- [ ] subscribe to ids only in the feed list, and have the feed items themselves subscribe to their feed by id (should cut down in the extreme case on over-subscribing, and can open up e.g. virtualization if needed)
- [ ] auto-download new episodes in subscribed feed
- [ ] offline using service worker
- restore scroll position when reloading and navigating
- cache all images from feeds
- respond to external media controls pausing / playing / rewind / ff

## Clean up UI

- episodes link to actual episode page
- move speed / sleep / ff / rewind / cast controls to the right spots (vertical over horizontal)
